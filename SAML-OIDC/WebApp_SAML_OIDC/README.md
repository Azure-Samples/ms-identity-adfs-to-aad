## Overview

This sample shows how in a ASP .NET web applications, we can use the libraries provided by Microsoft to sign-in users using multiple federation protocols.
This particular samples shows using SAML and OpenID Connect in the same web app.
This sample addresses complex scenarios where a developer might have to address multiple protocols when adjusting or incorporating multiple Identity Providers.

## Disclaimer

This sample does not intend to lay down the pattern or foundations of how this complex situation should be approached or done. This is instead provided as a good starting point for developers to start with and experiment further till it meets their eventual needs.

## Scenario

For Azure AD:

The client ASP.NET MVC web app uses the `Microsoft.Owin.Security.OpenIdConnect` to authenticate user using OpenID Connect protocol.

For ADFS:

Application uses the `Microsoft.Owin.Security.WsFederation` library for authenticating user using [SAML](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/single-sign-on-saml-protocol) protocol.

### Prerequisites

> This sample assumes that you already have an on-prem Active Directory and an AD FS environment.

- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
- [.NET Framework 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework)
- A SSL certificate to use during registering the app (Relying Party) on AD FS.
- An **Azure AD** tenant. For more information see: [How to get an Azure AD tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant)
- A user account in your **Azure AD** tenant. This sample will not work with a **personal Microsoft account**. Therefore, if you signed in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with a personal account and have never created a user account in your directory before, you need to do that now.

## Setup

### Step 1: Clone or download this repository

From your shell or command line:

```console
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-dotnet-adfs-to-aad.git
```

or download and extract the repository .zip file.

> :warning: To avoid path length limitations on Windows, we recommend cloning into a directory near the root of your drive.

## Configuring the sample on Azure AD

### Register the sample application(s) with your Azure Active Directory tenant

There is one project in this sample. To register it, you can:

- follow the steps below for manually register your apps
- or use PowerShell scripts that:
  - **automatically** creates the Azure AD applications and related objects (passwords, permissions, dependencies) for you.
  - modify the projects' configuration files.

<details>
  <summary>Expand this section if you want to use this automation:</summary>

> :warning: If you have never used **Azure AD Powershell** before, we recommend you go through the [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md) once to ensure that your environment is prepared correctly for this step.

1. On Windows, run PowerShell as **Administrator** and navigate to the root of the cloned directory
1. If you have never used Azure AD Powershell before, we recommend you go through the [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md) once to ensure that your environment is prepared correctly for this step.
1. In PowerShell run:

   ```PowerShell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process -Force
   ```

1. Run the script to create your Azure AD application and configure the code of the sample application accordingly.
1. In PowerShell run:

   ```PowerShell
   cd .\AppCreationScripts\
   .\Configure.ps1
   ```

   > Other ways of running the scripts are described in [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md)
   > The scripts also provide a guide to automated application registration, configuration and removal which can help in your CI/CD scenarios.

</details>

### Choose the Azure AD tenant where you want to create your applications

As a first step you'll need to:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. If your account is present in more than one Azure AD tenant, select your profile at the top right corner in the menu on top of the page, and then **switch directory** to change your portal session to the desired Azure AD tenant.

### Register the web app (Web-App-ASPNET)

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure AD** service.
1. Select the **App Registrations** blade on the left, then select **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `Web-App-ASPNET`.
   - Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.
   - In the **Redirect URI (optional)** section, select **Web** in the combo-box and enter the following redirect URI: `https://localhost:44347/`.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. In the app's registration screen, find and note the **Application (client) ID**. You use this value in your app's configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. In the app's registration screen, select **Authentication** in the menu.
   - If you don't have a platform added, select **Add a platform** and select the **Web** option.
   - In **Implicit grant** section, select the check box for **ID tokens**.
   - In the **Front-channel logout URL** section, set it to `https://localhost:44347/signout-oidc`.
1. Select **Save** to save your changes.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **API permissions** blade in the left to open the page where we add access to the APIs that your application needs.
   - Select the **Add a permission** button and then,
   - Ensure that the **Microsoft APIs** tab is selected.
   - In the *Commonly used Microsoft APIs* section, select **Microsoft Graph**
   - In the **Delegated permissions** section, select the **User.Read** in the list. Use the search box if necessary.
   - Select the **Add permissions** button at the bottom.

#### Configure the web app (Web-App-ASPNET) to use your app registration

Open the project in your IDE (like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code) to configure the code.

> In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

1. Open the `WebApp_SAML_OIDC\Web.config` file.
1. Find the key `ida:ClientId` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of `Web-App-ASPNET` app copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the key `ida:TenantId` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant ID.
1. Find the key `ida:Domain` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant name.

## Configuring the sample on an AD FS server

### Step 1: Add a Relying Party Trust

1. Log into the server in the on-prem Active Directory domain where AD FS is also installed.
1. Open the **Server Manager** Dashboard. Under Tools choose **AD FS Management**
1. Select **Add Relying Party Trust**
1. Click **Start**
1. Choose the option **Enter data about relying party manually** and click **Next**
1. Add a display name, for instance `WebApp_SAML`, and click **Next**
1. Choose the **AD FS profile** option and click **Next**
1. Click **Next** on the Configure Certificate step.
1. Click **Next** on the Configure URL step
1. Under Relying party trust identifier add your applicationâ€™s web URL (this sample uses `https://localhost:44347`)
1. Click **Add** and then click **Next**
    > For demo purposes, we have an IIS Express development certificate.
1. Click **Next** on the Configure Multi-factor Authentication if needed
1. Click **Next** on the Choose Issuance Authorization Rules if needed
1. Click **Next** on the Ready to Add Trust step if needed.
1. Close the wizard

### Step 2: Adding a Claim Policy

1. On the AD FS Management window, select **Relying Party Trust**
1. Select the application name that you have chosen on the previous step and click **Edit Claim Issuance Policy** on the right menu
1. In the new popup window, click **Add Rule**
1. Choose the Claim rule template as **Send LDAP Attributes as Claims** and click **Next**
1. Add a Claim rule name, for instance `Basic Claims`
1. Select **Active Directory** as the Attribute Store
1. Configure the LDAP attributes to outgoing claim types. Add the above four LDAP attributes and their corresponding outing claim type:
    - E-Mail-Addresses -> Email Address
    - User-Principal-Name -> UPN
    - Given-Name -> Given Name
    - Display-Name -> Name
    - Employee-ID -> EmployeeID
1. [*Optional*] Feel free to map other claims that are relevant in your scenario, like groups and directory extensions
1. Click **Finish**

### Step 3: Configure the .NET MVC application

This sample is using the NuGet package **Microsoft.Owin.Security.WsFederation** to configure the authentication with AD FS.

1. Open the **WebApp_SAML_OIDC** application
1. Open the *Web.config* file and replace the key `ida:ADFSMetadata` value with `https://[enter_your_ADFS_hostname]/federationmetadata/2007-06/federationmetadata.xml`

    For instance:

    ```xml
    <add key="ida:ADFSMetadata" value="https://sts.contoso.com/FederationMetadata/2007-06/FederationMetadata.xml" />
    ```

1. The key `ida:Wtrealm` is the current website URL. Since this sample is running on *localhost*, there is no need to update it.

## Running the sample

## About the code

1. In `Startup.cs`, update ConfigureAuth method to add authentication middleware.

    Below lines of code adds OpenID Connect authentication middleware:

    ```csharp
    app.UseOpenIdConnectAuthentication(
        new OpenIdConnectAuthenticationOptions
        {
            ClientId = clientId,
            Authority = authority,
            PostLogoutRedirectUri = postLogoutRedirectUri,
            Notifications = new OpenIdConnectAuthenticationNotifications()
            {
                SecurityTokenValidated = context =>
                {
                    var identity = context.AuthenticationTicket.Identity;
                    Claim claim = new Claim(Constants.AuthenticationType, OpenIdConnectAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationType);
                    identity.AddClaim(claim);
                    return Task.FromResult(0);
                }
            }
        });
    ```

    On SecurityTokenValidated event, a claim with name "AuthenticationType" is added in the claims collection to verify if the user has logged-in using OIDC or SAML.

    Below lines of code adds WsFederation authentication middleware:

    ```csharp
    app.UseWsFederationAuthentication(
        new WsFederationAuthenticationOptions
        {
            Wtrealm = realm,
            MetadataAddress = adfsMetadata,
            Wreply = "https://localhost:44347/"
         });
    ```

1. In `AccountController.cs`, SignIn method gets an input parameter and on the basis of that parameter use the required authentication protocol.

    ```csharp
    public void SignIn(bool isOIDC)
    {
        if (!Request.IsAuthenticated)
        {
            if (isOIDC)
            {
                HttpContext.GetOwinContext().Authentication.Challenge(new AuthenticationProperties { RedirectUri = "https://localhost:44347/" },
                OpenIdConnectAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationType);
            }
            else
            {
                HttpContext.GetOwinContext().Authentication.Challenge(new AuthenticationProperties { RedirectUri = "https://localhost:44347/" },
                    WsFederationAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationType);
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    SignOut method checks AuthenticationType claim and sign-out the user on the basis of that claim.

    ```csharp
    public void SignOut()
    {
        string callbackUrl = Url.Action("SignOutCallback", "Account", routeValues: null, protocol: Request.Url.Scheme);
        
        var claimsIdentity = (ClaimsIdentity)User.Identity;
        var claim = claimsIdentity.FindFirst(Constants.AuthenticationType);
     
        if (claim != null && claim.Value == OpenIdConnectAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationType)
        {
            HttpContext.GetOwinContext().Authentication.SignOut(
            new AuthenticationProperties { RedirectUri = callbackUrl },
            OpenIdConnectAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationType, CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationType);
        }
        else
        {
            HttpContext.GetOwinContext().Authentication.SignOut(
                new AuthenticationProperties { RedirectUri = callbackUrl },
                WsFederationAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationType, CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationType);
        }
    }
    ```
